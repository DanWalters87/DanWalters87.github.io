        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Please view the <a href="about.html"> About </a> page to see where I came from, today I'm working on HMS Defender a type 45 destroyer
typing this while waiting for a permit to dive. Being a key worker during lockdown is a relief, although it's a risk it keeps me sane.</p>
          <p> I come home every day and as much as I want to get busy coding I also
have a fiance at home that's bored in lockdown, spending time with her and studying in and around I do still get a
Few hours coding practice a day, playing around with a few ideas I have.</p>
<p> The best thing about creating sites and apps is I can do it anytime and anywhere with a tablet and keyboard, a weather day in the north sea I can build a whole website,
A basic one but it can be the start of a larger site I can build on during the sail in or during a 5 day decompression after a deep saturation job. </p>
<p> If you're not sure what saturation diving is, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SbAxa-_3h6E" > click here </a>, I'm good at what I do, as well as everything else I set my mind to
I can easily code a site for someone and work as a diver also.
